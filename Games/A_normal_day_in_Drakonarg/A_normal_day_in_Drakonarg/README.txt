
You need a few things to check in order to play it.

First, do you have the latest .NET SDK installed?
Check the offical Microsoft dotnet website (https://dotnet.microsoft.com/) to download and install the latest version for your sytem.

Second, how do you want to run the game?
There are several ways to play it. I will describe two of them in detail.
Extract the files in a folder of your choice. Make sure to remember the path of this folder.
E.g. C:/user/MyDocuments/A_normal_day_in_Drakonarg

CMD/Bash:
After your system recognizes the "dotnet" command in your console navigate to the gamefiles and type "dotnet run".
After a short time you should see the first Question of the Game: "What is your name, adventurer?"

Visual Studio Code (VSC):
If you want to run the game with VSC proceed as followed:
Navigate to "File" -> "Open Folder..." in VSC. Now open the folder you extracted the game to.
The project should now be visible in VSC.
Open the terminal through "View" -> "Terminal" and type "dotnet run".

Thank you for downloading this game and enjoy :)
